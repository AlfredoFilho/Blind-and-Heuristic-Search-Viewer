  <h1>About Search Algorithms Visualizer</h1>

  <div class="info-box">
    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      This web application provides a visual representation of several common pathfinding search algorithms.
      It's designed to help understand how these algorithms explore a grid to find a path from a starting point to an
      ending point, while avoiding obstacles.
    </p>

    <h3>Algorithms Implemented</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h4>
        <p>
          BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root
          (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores all of the neighbor
          nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. It is commonly used
          to find the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Depth-First Search (DFS)</h4>
        <p>
          DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the
          root (or arbitrarily chosen node) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
          It is often used for finding connected components.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Best-First Search</h4>
        <p>
          Best-First Search is a greedy search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising node
          chosen according to a specified rule. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost from the current node
          to the goal.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>A* Search</h4>
        <p>
          A* Search is an informed search algorithm that finds the shortest path between a starting and a target
          node in a weighted graph. It combines the features of Dijkstra's algorithm (which guarantees the shortest
          path) and greedy best-first search (which is fast but not guaranteed to find the shortest path). A* uses a
          heuristic function to estimate the distance to the goal, and a cost function to track the actual cost from the
          start node.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Use</h3>
    <p>
      On the main page, you can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong style="color: black">Select Start:</strong> Click the "üü† Select Start" button and then click on a cell on the canvas to set the starting point.</li>
      <li><strong style="color: black">Select End:</strong> Click the "üîµ Select End" button and then click on a cell on the canvas to set the ending point.</li>
      <li><strong style="color: black">Add/Remove Block:</strong> Click the "‚ùå Add/Remove Block" button and then click on cells to create or remove obstacles.</li>
      <li><strong style="color: black">Run Algorithms:</strong> Click on the buttons for "üß≠ Start DFS", "üìò Start BFS", "üß† Start Best-First", or "‚≠ê Start A\*" to see the respective algorithm in action.</li>
      <li><strong style="color: black">Reset Board:</strong> Click the "üîÑ Reset Board" button to clear the grid and start over.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>
      This project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The visualization is rendered on an HTML5 Canvas.
      Each search algorithm is implemented in a separate JavaScript module for clarity and maintainability.
